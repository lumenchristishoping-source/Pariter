# Virtual Storage — To-do

Tracking what's next so nothing gets lost between sessions.

- [x] **File sharing** — built (`vstorage/sharing.py`) and proven: A
      falls a piece, hands it to B at the next break instead of
      bouncing back to itself, B continues falling it independently.
      Tested with real, separate processes; byte-perfect every time.
      Full RAM tracked through a run too (`sharing_tracked.py`).
- [x] **Running multiple files** — `test_multiple_files.py`: 6 real
      files (JSON, Python, prose, GeoJSON map, PDF, DOCX) held and
      falling at the same time (18 boxes at once). All 6 byte-perfect,
      nothing crossed between files.

Update this list as items are explained, built, and verified.
